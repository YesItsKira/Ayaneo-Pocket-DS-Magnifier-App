# Pocket DS Magnifier

Pocket DS Magnifier is a simple utility app made specifically for the **AYANEO Pocket DS** (dual-screen Android handheld).

It mirrors the **top screen onto the bottom screen**, so you can **zoom in and pan around** like a magnifying glass — perfect for things like **minimaps**, small UI text, inventory grids, or any on-screen details that are hard to see at a glance.

## Inspiration

This app was inspired by the **magnification trick on the AYANEO (AYA NEO) AYN/AYN Thor**, where you can use a second display as a live “magnified” view of the main screen. This brings the same idea to the **Pocket DS** in a dedicated, game-friendly way.

## How to use

1. Open **Pocket DS Magnifier**
2. Tap **Start mirroring**
3. When Android shows the screen capture prompt, tap **Start now**
4. Look at the **bottom screen** — it will now show a live view of your **top screen**
5. Use gestures on the **bottom screen**:
   - **Pinch** to zoom in/out
   - **Drag with one finger** to pan around
   - **Double tap** to reset the view
   - **3-finger tap** to open/close the tuning overlay (AA + sharpness)

### Anti-aliasing mode
On the main page you can choose:
- **FXAA**
- **SMAA (experimental)**

SMAA can look cleaner in some games, but it’s marked experimental because visuals can vary depending on the game’s UI style.

## Features

### Live dual-screen magnifier
- Shows the **top screen** on the **bottom screen** in real time.
- Designed to work naturally as a “magnifying lens” while you keep playing on the main screen.

### Smooth zoom + pan controls
- Pinch zoom and panning are designed for quick minimap inspection without interrupting gameplay.

### Fit at 1×, Fill when zoomed
- At **1× zoom**, it shows the full top screen view (no stretching).
- When you **zoom in**, it automatically fills the bottom screen (no black bars while magnifying).

### Image tuning overlay (3-finger tap)
A 3-finger tap on the bottom screen shows sliders for:
- **AA Strength** (affects the currently selected AA mode)
- **Sharpness** (separately tuned per mode)

This lets you dial in the best look for your specific game/minimap:
- More AA = smoother edges, less jaggedness
- More sharpness = clearer detail, but too high can shimmer

## Notes

- This app uses Android’s screen capture system, so Android will always show the **“Start now”** confirmation prompt.
- Visual results depend on the game and UI style — especially for minimaps that are constantly moving.

Enjoy, and tweak the overlay settings until the minimap looks perfect for your game.
