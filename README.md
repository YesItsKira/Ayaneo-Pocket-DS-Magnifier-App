# Ayaneo-Pocket-DS-Magnifier-App
This is a repo for development of an app that magnifies an area of the top screen for viewing on the bottom screen of the Ayaneo Pocket DS. 

It records the top screen, displays it on the bottom screen. Pinch geatsures can be used to move the image around.

However, as the resolution becomes lower the more you zoom, fsr and antialiasing is implemented to clean up the image

All together, the program is very lightweight and uses about 2% of cpu resources
